# covid-19-lesions-detection-in-pneumonia-patients.

This repository contains all the code files of project "covid-19-lesions-detection-in-pneumonia-patients". In this project a UNET-2D model is used to detect lesion from CT-SCANS of patients, which will differentiate between two classes 1.Pneumonia 2.COVID-19 pneumonia.
